# PLANE-CRASH-ANALYSIS-FOR-30-DAYS-OF-LEARNING-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
PLANE CRASH ANALYSIS ALL AROUND THE WORLD FROM 1908-2010 

# INTRODUCTION 
THIS PROJECT IS FOR THE #30DAYSOFLEARNING, To display my skills in the analysis of data in the data analytics track of the #30DAYSOFLEARNING using POWER BI , and all the overall steps involved( E-T-l, DATA MODELLING,EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS AND EXPLANORYANALYSIS/VISUALIZATION)                                                                   
## OBJECTIVE 
After being assigned this project to analyse the data by my project cordinator, i carefully accessed the data. 
And after much critical thinking, i found out questions that needed to be answered: 

1. Total number of flights that crashed from year 1908-2010 
2. Total number of people aboard the crashed flights from year 1908-2010
3. Total number of survivors from the crashed flights 
4. Total number of fatalities as a result of the crashed flights
5. The major causes of flight crashes 
6. The route with the major fatalitis caused by flashed crashes
7. The location with highest fatalities

## DATA SOURCE 
since 1908 (full history of airplane crashes throughout the world) until 2010. At the time this dataset was created and hosted by Kaggle in(2016-06-09), the original version was hosted by Open Data by socrata at: https://opendata.socrata.com/Government/Airplane-Crashes-and-Fatalities-Since-1908/q2te-8cvq, but unfortunately that is not available anymore. The dataset contains data of airplane accidents involving civil,commercial and military transport worldwide from 1908-09-17 to 2009-06-08.         

#### [DATA SOURCE:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908]

## DATA EXTRACTION AND LOADING 
The data was extracted from the data source above and loaded into POWER BI using the get data from web feature on power bi

## DATA TRANSFORMATION/CLEANING  
After loading the data into POWER BI the data was cleaned and transformed using power query in power bi

## DATA MODELLING 
The data was denormalized( the data was in one table) therefore the data doesnt require additional manual modelling by me, so the data was ready for visualization right after transforming and loading

## EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS 
i worked on the data to derive insights and to crack all the neccessary information the dataset has hidden in it, and also to answer my questions/objectives 

## EXPLANATORY ANALYSIS 
After working on the data, going through the data exploratory analysis ohase i got quite some interesting insights and the answers to my questions/ objectives 

1. #### this visual gives us insight into our first, second and third visual 
- We can clearly see that over the year 1908-2010 there was 5,268 flight crashes recorded around the globe
- We  can also see that the number passengers aboard this total of 5,268 flights was 145,000(145k) 
- And also we can see that 39,000 passengers survived the crashes. well, i had always thought everyone involved in a flight crash would always die, like common i mean the high altitude(scary) LOL, but No, wow! that doesn't happen to be the case.   

According to WikiHow; 
the odds of dying on a commercial airline flight are actually as low as 9 million to 1. That said, a lot can go wrong at 33,000 feet (10,058.4m) above the ground , and if you,re unlucky to be aboard when something does , the decisions you make could mean the difference between life and death. Almost 95% of flight crashes have survivors, so even if the worst does happens your odds rent as bad as you think.
