# PLANE-CRASH-ANALYSIS-FOR-30-DAYS-OF-LEARNING-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
PLANE CRASH ANALYSIS ALL AROUND THE WORLD FROM 1908-2010 

# INTRODUCTION 
THIS PROJECT IS FOR THE #30DAYSOFLEARNING, To display my skills in the analysis of data in the data analytics track of the #30DAYSOFLEARNING using POWER BI , and all the overall steps involved( E-T-l, DATA MODELLING,EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS AND EXPLANORYANALYSIS/VISUALIZATION)                                                                   
## OBJECTIVE 
After being assigned this project to analyse the data by my project cordinator, i carefully accessed the data. 
And after much critical thinking, i found out questions that need to be answered: 

1. Total number of flights that crashed from year 1908-2010 
2. Total number of people aboard the crashed flights from year 1908-2010
3. Total number of fatalities as a result of the crashed flights
4. Total number of survivors from the crashed flights 
5. The major causes flight crashes 
6. the route with the major crashes
7.   





## DATA SOURCE 
since 1908 (full history of airplane crashes throughout the world) until 2010. At the time this dataset was created and hosted by Kaggle in(2016-06-09), the original version was hosted by Open Data by socrata at: https://opendata.socrata.com/Government/Airplane-Crashes-and-Fatalities-Since-1908/q2te-8cvq, but unfortunately that is not available anymore. The dataset contains data of airplane accidents involving civil,commercial and military transport worldwide from 1908-09-17 to 2009-06-08.

## DATA EXTRACTION AND LOADING 
The data was extracted from the data source above and loaded into POWER BI using the get data from web feature on power bi

## DATA TRANSFORMATION/CLEANING  
After loading the data into POWER BI the data was cleaned and transformed using power query in power bi

## DATA MODELLING 
The data was denormalized( the data was in one table) therfor the data doesnt require additional manual modelling by me, therefore the data was ready for visualization right after transforming and loading
